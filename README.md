An android snake game, where the snake is controlled by the gyro.

Current status

The mechanics works, but there are no level select, highscore or fancy stuff like that.

Why I did this
--------------

Mostly for my own enjoyment, and to reherse some math. I'm already familiar with the Android echo system, so there were no new technical challenges for me. However, during the course of a project you always learn at least something :)
